# Context

The Context module forms the heart of the project minimization plugin. It provides essential abstractions and functionalities that manage execution state, including tracking call traces, parameter caching, import reference counting, and more. This module defines interfaces and multiple context implementations that work together to ensure the plugin operates reliably and efficiently.

## Overview of Context Interfaces and Implementations

### IJDDContext
- Serves as a foundational interface for context-related functionality within the plugin.
- Establishes a consistent contract that various context implementations adhere to.

### IJDDContextMonad
- Provides a monadic wrapper around the IJDDContext interface, enabling composable and functional manipulation of context objects.
- Facilitates chaining of operations and handling of potential failures in a functional style.

### WithCallTraceParameterCacheContext
- An implementation that incorporates call tracing into the execution context.
- Includes caching strategies for parameters passed during method calls, which enhances performance and debugging capabilities.

### WithImportRefCounterContext
- Focuses on tracking and counting import references across the project.
- Helps in the minimization process by providing insights into which imports are frequently used, aiding in the analysis and removal of unused code.

## Snapshotting Mechanism

The snapshot submodule is dedicated to capturing and restoring the state of the plugin's context. Snapshots are crucial for maintaining consistency during complex operations, facilitating error recovery, and enabling state rollback when necessary.

### Snapshot Module Components

#### SnapshotMonad
- Implements a monadic interface for snapshot operations, promoting a functional style for chaining operations.
- Simplifies error handling by encapsulating snapshot computations within the monadic structure.

#### SnapshotManager
- Acts as the central controller for creating and managing snapshots.
- Integrates with the context components to capture a comprehensive view of the current state.

#### SnapshotError
- Defines specific errors related to the snapshotting process.
- Provides clear error reporting for issues encountered while taking or restoring snapshots.

### Project Cloning in Snapshots

Within the snapshot module, the implementation in the 'impl' subfolder plays a key role:

#### ProjectCloningSnapshotManager
- Offers functionality to clone the entire project state as part of the snapshot process.
- Ensures that snapshots capture all necessary aspects of the project, facilitating robust rollback and restoration capabilities.
